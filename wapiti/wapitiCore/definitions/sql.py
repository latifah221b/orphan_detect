TYPE = "vulnerability"

NAME = "SQL Injection"
SHORT_NAME = "SQLI"

WSTG_CODE = ["WSTG-INPV-05"]

DESCRIPTION = (
    "SQL injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to alter the queries executed on the backend database."
) + " " + (
    "An attacker may then be able to extract or modify information stored in the database or even escalate his "
    "privileges on the system."
) + " " + (
    "Blind SQL injection is a technique that exploits a vulnerability occurring in the database of an application."
) + " " + (
    "This kind of vulnerability is harder to detect than basic SQL injections because no error message will be "
    "displayed on the webpage."
)

SOLUTION = (
    "To protect against SQL injection, user input must not directly be embedded in SQL statements."
) + " " + (
    "Instead, user input must be escaped or filtered or parameterized statements must be used."
)
