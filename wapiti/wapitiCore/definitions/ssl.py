NAME = "TLS/SSL misconfigurations"
SHORT_NAME = "SSL misconfigurations"

WSTG_CODE = ["WSTG-CRYP-01"]

DESCRIPTION = (
    "The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between "
    "two or more communicating computer applications."
) + " " + (
    "Over the years numerous vulnerabilities have been discovered in some SSL/TLS version or specific ciphers making "
    "the integrity of the communications at risk (eavesdropping, alteration...)"
)

SOLUTION = (
    "To protect against SSL/TLS vulnerabilities make sure that deprecated versions of the protocol are disabled."
) + " " + (
    "Refer to up-to-date recommendations to only allow modern versions of TLS with Perfect Forward Secrecy."
